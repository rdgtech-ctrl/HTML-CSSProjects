It sets a linear gradient background that transittions horizontally (from left to right)
between two colors;
linear-gradient(....) Creates a smooth transition between colors
90 deg means left to right
0 deg would be top to bottom

transform: translate(-150px, -100px);
shifts the position of the section::before pseudo-element from where it would normally be placed do you wanna know why
translatge(X,Y): moves the element without affecting the document layout.
-150px on X-axis:Moves it 150 pixels to the left
-100px on Y-axis: Moves it 100 pixels upward
rgba =Red,Green,Blue,Alpha
255,255,255=Pure white
0.1=10% opacity(very transparent)

z-index controls the stacking order of elements along the z-aixs (front to back)
Higer z-index values are placed above lower ones
if the value of z-index:positive; That means the element will be in front of lower or default elements
z-index:0 or auto : means the Position in Stack is Normal/default stacking position
z-index:negative : means it will move behind other elements

box-shadow:[horizontal-offset] [vertical-offset][blur-radius] rgba[black,25% opacity (light,see-through shadow)]

backdrop-filter applies visuals effect to whatever is behind the element
blur(25px) means the background behind the element is blurred heavily 25px blur radius.

display:flex;
align-items:flex-end;
Items will be laid out horizontally(left to right)
align-items:flex-end; will push all items to the bottom of the container.

So yes - bottom-left is where the first items sits, and the rest flow to the right, all aligned at the bottom.


repeating-linear-gradient(#fff, #fff 3px, #efefef 0px, #efefef 9px);
Repeats the gradient infinitely in one direction(top to bottom)
#fff Starts with white color
#fff 3px white color continues until 3px down
#efefef 0px 
This resets the next color(light gray) to start immediately after white.
This 0px refers to relative to the last stop 
z-index:-1 z-index negative is used when we push an element into the background


When you rotate an element with transform:rotateY(180deg) or similar 3D transforms, the backface(the reverse side) becomes visible


transform-style: preserve-3d;
when you hover .container flips 180deg in Y-axis.
The back-face card becomes visible
preserve-3D ensures that the front stays at 0 deg and the back stats rotated not flattened.

perspectivel controls the distance betweenthe viewer and element

The card is showing is showing clockwise rotation on the Y - axis like turning a physical card to the right
