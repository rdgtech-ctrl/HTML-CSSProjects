box-sizing: border-box;
width: 200px;
padding: 20px;
border: 5px solid black;

total width remains 200px inside the 200px 20px is padding 5px is border and remaining space is content

why box-sizing border-box useful in my code because if later you add padding or borders to classes  those paddings would not increase total size and break your layout
